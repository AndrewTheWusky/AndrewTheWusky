### ðŸ«  About Me ðŸ« 
Hello, I am a sixteen year old Lua developer, I am starting out FiveM Development for the first time, i have been coding Lua for over a year now. I mostly interact on discord reather then Github, and i mainly use tebex, I have almost all social media including an account on the famous FiveM forum. I have a passion for creating re-usable content online for years now, now i am finally able to acheve that. My goal in life is to be a creator, help improve roleplay on FiveM and other future GTA RP series.

As you can also tell, I am a furry, however don't worry, I am not into any freaky aniaml shit as people might expect, I just like to represent my spirit animal.
